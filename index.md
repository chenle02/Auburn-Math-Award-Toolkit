## Nomination Workflow

The nomination process is coordinated by the Award Committee. Here's how it works:

<ol class="steps">
<li><strong>Step 1: Nomination Letter</strong><br>
A faculty member submits a nomination letter to the Award Committee, identifying the nominee and the award.</li>

<li><strong>Step 2: Contact Nominee</strong><br>
The Award Committee contacts the nominee to request:
<ul>
<li>Teaching evaluations (from Auburn's system)</li>
<li>Current CV</li>
<li>Names and contact information of potential letter writers</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Step 3: Request Support Letters</strong><br>
Upon receiving the nominee's materials, the Award Committee contacts the letter writers to request support letters.</li>

<li><strong>Step 4: Assemble the Package</strong><br>
After all materials are collected, the Award Committee assembles the complete nomination package using the LaTeX templates provided here.</li>

<li><strong>Step 5: Selection</strong><br>
The Award Committee convenes to review all nomination packages and select the award recipient(s).</li>
</ol>

### For Nominators

If you wish to nominate a colleague, simply send a nomination letter to the Award Committee Chair (see contact info below). The committee will handle the rest of the process.

### For Committee Members

See [How to Use](how-to-use) for detailed instructions on assembling nomination packages using the LaTeX templates.

## Template Packages (For Committee Use)

Each award has a LaTeX template package for assembling the final nomination PDF:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Nomination_Package_<Award>.tex` | Main LaTeX file — assembles all materials into one professionally formatted PDF |
| `nomination-package.sty` | Shared style file with custom commands (`\vfile`, `\hfile`, `\myPart`) |
| Placeholder PDFs | Mock files to be replaced with actual collected documents |
| `README.md` | Award-specific checklist and instructions |

**Resources:**
- [Email Templates](email-templates) — Sample emails for contacting nominees and letter writers
- [How to Use](how-to-use) — Step-by-step guide for assembling packages

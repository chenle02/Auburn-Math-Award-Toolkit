## What's in Each Template Package?

Every template package includes:

- **`Nomination_Package_<Award>.tex`** --- Main LaTeX file that assembles all materials into a single, professionally formatted PDF with table of contents, page numbers, and nominee name in the footer.
- **`nomination-package.sty`** --- Shared LaTeX style file with all custom commands (`\vfile`, `\hfile`, `\myPart`, etc.).
- **Placeholder PDFs** --- Mock files (`Nomination_Letter.pdf`, `CV.pdf`, `Teaching_Evals_YYYY.pdf`, `Support_Letter_*.pdf`) to be replaced with real documents.
- **`README.md`** --- Award-specific instructions, checklist, and tips.
- **Email templates** --- Sample emails for requesting nomination and support letters.
